# Crackme
 Some do sudoku; i break things

Repo where i will upload crackme that i am doing from now on, i will not upload the old ones since they are all undocumented.
The level of difficulty is based on how i consider it would be for someone inexperienced and experienced, maybe you don't match my criteria, but you're not me, do you want to be me?
I don't have a preference for one or the other, but i usually avoid all obfuscated .NET, since they make me very lazy, it's more fun when the person who creates the crackme thinks and makes me think instead of just using an obfuscation tool, which is they crack anyway but making me waste more time u_u.

I hope you dare to do one of them!
